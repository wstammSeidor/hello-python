# Overview

This small project is part of my journey to strengthen my programming skills by building and sharing software regularly. As a software developer, I aim to create a strong foundation in core programming concepts and practice publishing my work professionally using tools like GitHub and Markdown.

This simple Python script greets the user, generates a random lucky number, and includes a small countdown animation to make the interaction more engaging. It serves as the starting point of my personal software portfolio.
